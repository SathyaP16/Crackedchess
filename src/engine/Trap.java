/**
 * CONCEPT: Simple Data-Holder Class (Plain Old Java Object — POJO)
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Not every class needs complex logic. Trap's job is simply to RECORD that a
 * trap exists at a certain position, placed by a certain player. Board.java
 * handles activation (removing the trap when triggered). RulesEngine handles
 * visibility logic. Trap itself just holds data.
 *
 * This is the INFORMATION EXPERT principle: a class should hold the data it
 * needs to describe itself, and other classes that need to ACT on traps (Board,
 * RulesEngine) access that data through Trap's getters.
 *
 * GAME RULES RECAP (from the spec):
 *   - Traps cost 3 coins and consume the player's entire turn.
 *   - A player can place a maximum of 3 traps TOTAL across the whole game.
 *   - A trap activates when an opponent's piece steps on it — the piece is
 *     destroyed and the trap disappears.
 *   - Exception: the King cannot be killed by a trap. If the King steps on a
 *     trap, the trap is simply removed and the King survives.
 *   - Traps are always visible to the owner.
 *   - Traps are visible to the opponent's king if within a 1-square radius
 *     (Chebyshev distance ≤ 1).
 *   - All other opponent pieces cannot see traps.

     * Chebyshev distance counts diagonals as 1 step, matching how a King moves.

     * (including diagonals) — exactly the right "sensing radius" for the spec.
